Hi, I'm Nischal! I love using Python, R, and JavaScript to build fun and useful tools for data scientists. Currently, I'm a Data Science Educator at RStudio where I'm building autograding tools for [Academy](https://www.rstudio.com/academy/). I have worked on some R packages around autograding like [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html), or [ggcheck](https://github.com/rstudio/ggcheck/) to facilitate grading for interactive tutorials.

I did my PhD in Computer Science at North Carolina State University from 2016-2022. My dissertation explored Just-In-Time learning tools for data science programming with [Chris Parnin](http://chrisparnin.me) in the alt-code lab. You can read my [dissertation](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.20/39802?show=full) to learn more!

Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, running, lifting, watching/discussing tv shows/movies, listening to or [playing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGoH54n9UCn8ez7NjjhyMA/about) music, and coding for fun.
