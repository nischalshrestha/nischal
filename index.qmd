Hi, I'm Nischal! I love using Python, R, and JavaScript to build fun and useful tools for data scientists. Previously, I worked at Posit (formerly RStudio) where I built autograding tools for Python in [Academy](https://www.rstudio.com/academy/).
I have also worked on OSS like [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) or [ggcheck](https://github.com/rstudio/ggcheck/) for autograding, and [Unravel](https://github.com/nischalshrestha/Unravel) for exploring and learning about code.

I did my PhD in Computer Science at North Carolina State University from 2016-2022 where I explored just-in-time learning tools for data science programming with [Chris Parnin](http://chrisparnin.me) in the alt-code lab. You can read my [dissertation](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.20/39802?show=full) to learn more!

Outside of work, I enjoy running, powerlifting, watching/discussing tv shows/movies, listening to or [making music](music/music.qmd), and coding for fun.
