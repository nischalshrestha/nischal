## Sonic Pi

Since 2020, I've been really into making code-based music using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net) a tool created by Sam Aaron, which is both the programming language and the editor. 

Below are some that I'm proud of. Please like/comment/subscribe! :laughing:

### Arps 1

This one is a recreation of a really nice modular synthesis progression by Colin Benders in one of his pandemic jams [Lockdown Day 40](https://youtu.be/iF8Lgj-jzAo?t=9132) :metal:

Electro-disco-house type tune. :dancer:

### The Conjuring

Fun cover of the opening music of The Conjuring movie. :scream:

### Ambient 1

Just a chill piece, which felt like tending an ambient garden. :seedling: :shower:
