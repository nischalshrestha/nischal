During my RStudio internship in 2020, I explored a wonderful package in R called [`{learnr}`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html), used to author interactive lessons. My goal was to try to add Python support, so we can start making Python lessons which led me to [PR #390](https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/pull/390) that adds support for learnr exercises for any language supported by [`{knitr}`](https://yihui.org/knitr/). One of the features that I hadn't planned on adding required implementing "chained setup chunks" so that each setup chunk associated with an exercise could further reference another setup chunk. 

In the interest of being terse, I wrote a [post](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/07/learning-learnr/) on the RStudio Education blog that describes the main stages of writing to rendering and interacting with `learnr` documents. For the nerds out there, I also illustrated basic architecture and the tech stacks involved with `learnr` and a "simple" way to think about the package.
