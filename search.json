    "text": "Enter Unravel\n\nUnravel is a project that explores interactive exploration of data science code written in R. Unravel (paper + talk), enables data scientists to interactively inspect, understand and explore data wrangling code written using a fluent API like the tidyverse.\nThis is just a teaser blog post to what I’m realizing is about to be a series so keep an eye on the next part where I dive deeper into how I designed Unravel."

    "text": "In the interest of being terse, I wrote a post on the RStudio Education blog that describes the main stages of writing to rendering and interacting with learnr documents. For the nerds out there, I also illustrated basic architecture and the tech stacks involved with learnr and a “simple” way to think about the package."

    "text": "I did my PhD in Computer Science at North Carolina State University from 2016-2022. My dissertation explored Just-In-Time learning tools for data science programming with Chris Parnin in the alt-code lab. You can read my dissertation to learn more!\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, running, lifting, watching/discussing tv shows/movies, listening to or playing music, and coding for fun."

To appear in UIST 2021: 34th ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology\n[DOI | PDF | Talk]\n\nWe built a tool called Unravel to help data scientists understand and explore fluent code via structured edits using drag-and-drop and toggle switch interactions. Through a think-aloud user study with 14 data scientists, we found that Unravel facilitated diverse activities such as validating assumptions about the code or data, exploring alternatives, and understanding function behavior.\n\nRemote, but Connected: How #TidyTuesday Provides an Online Community of Practice for Data Scientists. Nischal Shrestha, Titus Barik and Chris Parnin. CSCW 2021: 24th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing\n[DOI | PDF | Talk]\n\nThrough semi-structured interviews with 26 data scientists, we uncovered motivations behind their participation in #TidyTuesday, how the project benefited them, and how it cultivated an online CoP.\n\n\n\n2020\n\nHere We Go Again: Why Is It Difficult for Developers to Learn Another Programming Language? Nischal Shrestha, Colton Botta, Titus Barik and Chris Parnin. ICSE 2020: 42nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering. Won an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award.\n[DOI | PDF | Talk]\n\nWe found that previous programming language knowledge can interfere with learning another programming language.\n\n\n\n2019\n\nInstrument Designs for Validating Cross-Language Behavioral Differences Nischal Shrestha and Chris Parnin. 2019 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)\n[DOI | PDF]\n\nWe designed three instruments that can help identify and validate meaningful behavior differences between two languages to pinpoint potential misconceptions.\n\nExploring Tools and Strategies Used During Regular Expression Composition Tasks Gina R. Bai, Brian Clee, Nischal Shrestha, Carl Chapman, Cimone Wright, Kathryn T. Stolee. 2019 IEEE/ACM 27th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC)\n[DOI | PDF]\n\nWe conducted an exploratory case study to reveal the tools and strategies developers use during regular expression composition.\n\n\n\n2018\n\nIt’s Like Python But: Towards Supporting Transfer of Programming Language Knowledge Nischal Shrestha, Titus Barik and Chris Parnin. 2018 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC)\n[DOI | PDF]\n\nWe explored a prototype transfer tool to support learning new programming languages, given experience in one or more languages."
