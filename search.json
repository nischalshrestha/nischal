    "text": "📢 I’m currently seeking a new job!\nIf you are looking for a software engineer who has experience in Python, R, package development, research and more, please reach out to me via linkedin or my email!\n\nHi, I’m Nischal! I love using Python, R, and JavaScript to build fun and useful tools for data scientists. Previously, I worked at Posit (formerly RStudio) where I built autograding tools for Python in Academy. I have also worked on OSS like learnr or ggcheck for autograding, and Unravel for exploring and learning about code.\n\nI did my PhD in Computer Science at North Carolina State University from 2016-2022 where I explored Just-In-Time learning tools for data science programming with Chris Parnin in the alt-code lab. You can read my dissertation to learn more!\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy running, powerlifting, watching/discussing tv shows/movies, listening to or making music, and coding for fun."

    "text": "During my RStudio internship in 2020, I explored a wonderful package in R called {learnr}, used to author interactive lessons. My goal was to try to add Python support, so we can start making Python lessons which led me to PR #390 that adds support for learnr exercises for any language supported by {knitr}. One of the features that I hadn’t planned on adding required implementing “chained setup chunks” so that each setup chunk associated with an exercise could further reference another setup chunk.\nIn the interest of being terse, I wrote a post on the RStudio Education blog that describes the main stages of writing to rendering and interacting with learnr documents. For the nerds out there, I also illustrated basic architecture and the tech stacks involved with learnr and a “simple” way to think about the package."

UIST 2021: 34th ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology\n[DOI | PDF | Talk]\n\nWe built a tool called Unravel to help data scientists understand and explore fluent code via structured edits using drag-and-drop and toggle switch interactions. Through a think-aloud user study with 14 data scientists, we found that Unravel facilitated diverse activities such as validating assumptions about the code or data, exploring alternatives, and understanding function behavior.\n\nRemote, but Connected: How #TidyTuesday Provides an Online Community of Practice for Data Scientists.
